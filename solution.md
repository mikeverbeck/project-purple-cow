# SOLUTION

Future: (updates, changes, outstanding code)
 * Bootstrap css and js is typically packaged via sprockets or webpack.  I opted to use the CDN due to time contraints.
 * Items index should be paginated 
 * Clean up CSRF token hack
 * Update POST /items to accept an array of item objects 
 * Add a json response for deleting id's that do not exist
 * Enhance docker to support multiple environments (currently setup in development env)
